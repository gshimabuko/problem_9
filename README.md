 * @brief   Repository for the second technical challenge of a problem set for a 
 * C++ Software Engineer position at <confidential>
 *          
 *
 * @details This project consists of a C++ program designed to determine the 
 * length of a string without using any built-in functions.
 * 
 * The src directory contains the files stringLength.cpp and test.cpp.
 * The first file implements the Length function, which calculates the string's
 * length using a while loop.
 * The test.cpp file includes a simple test of the function with where
 * a hard-coded string is used and its length is printed on the screen.
 *
 * The includes directory has a header file for the Length function.
 *
 * The obj file is where the temporary files from the compilation are written. 
 *
 * A makefile is included to compile the project. To compile, simply run the 
 * command "make" on an environment with the g++ compiler. Once compiled, the file * test.out is generated. Running out provides the functions' output.
